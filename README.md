# The Phase of Privilege_Escalation-

Privilige escalation is one of  the very important phase of  web application exploitation for both for both ethical hackers as well as the black hat hackers.

Most times after system exploitation by any means of method / vulnerbility , there are the very fair chances of getting of the very low -privelaged access to the operating system shell .This leads to limiting the further activity of the hacker/pentester .
So , its require to increase the shell priveleges after  the first phase of the exploitation . 

now ,there are multiple attack vectors that can help in escalating the privileges of the shell. 

So , to save the time consumption in manually testing of the various possible vulnerbilities may be in operating system , network configuration , incorrect permission levels and any other vulnerbility . 

I used to write some automated testing scripts in boths as bash scripts for unix/linux and in python also for other windows like operating systems also .
